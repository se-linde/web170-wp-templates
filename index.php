    <h1>About Cornerstone Consulting</h1>
	       
<p>Aimee Elber, Manager of Disability Support Services at Spokane Community College, holds over a decade of experience in higher education and has worked with people with disabilities since 1994. As a first generation college graduate, Aimee started her academic career in the community college system and completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in Human Services at Western Washington University. She is driven by a deep desire to help students meet their academic and occupational goals.</p>
    
    <p>While pursuing her college education, Aimee began her career with the Washington State Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) as a Governor’s Intern and was later hired as a Rehabilitation Technician. Working with DVR inspired her to seek out opportunities to help people with disabilities successfully enter the workforce. Building on her experience, she worked as a Career Counselor and Academic Advisor at Lake Washington Technical College and later sought employment as a Disability Services Specialist in the Seattle Community Colleges District. She then transitioned to a job in Workforce Education to supplement her existing skills. Aimee served as Assistant Director of Student Services at Pacific Northwest College of Art in Portland, Oregon and later as Coordinator of Disability Services at Clackamas Community College. </p>
      
    <p>Aimee adheres to a strengths-based “person first” philosophy, viewing individuals holistically and focusing on assets rather than barriers. She is committed to diversity, multiculturalism, and fostering a safe learning environment. Working with people in a variety of roles has allowed Aimee the opportunity to help individuals become empowered advocates for themselves and their education.</p>
      
    <p>Aimee brings a diverse skill set to the table including a broad knowledge base surrounding ADA compliance, Universal Design, Career Counseling theory, Appreciative Inquiry, Veteran’s Services, and Workforce Education. She is proficient in American Sign Language, trained as a Dependable Strengths Level I Facilitator, and certified to administer and interpret the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.  She is currently pursuing her Master’s degree with a focus in Organizational Leadership.</p>
